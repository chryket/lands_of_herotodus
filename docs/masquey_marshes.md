in response to an internet comment. 

Hi lee. I noticed the movie stopped and rewound. What happens next in the first scene? Is the free human taken down by the mob or the police? Are there other harms that may result as a consequence of this new behaviour?
Do we want to lose theatre and song? 

what does the science say? I had a look at the sources you offered and to paraphrase the great Inigo Montoya, I do not think that word(reputable) means what you think it means.

Your first source is a SA government press release. We are told explicitly not to use surgical masks. They acknowledge "much debate", but reference no science, and stress the complexity of using a face mask correctly.

Your second source is again the government: another propaganda-art piece selling a false idea. I would refer you to Drs Fauci and Redfield, who have stated publicly that no pandemic in history has been driven by asymptomatic transmission, and that healthy people should not be wearing masks. 

Your third source is john hopkins, and its mostly a fluff piece that only references the CDC. 



All of your quoted sources stress the lack of evidence and that incorrect use may be harmful. I did a bit of digging myself and found this https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7518963/ where they say:

	There is no direct evidence in humans available (National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine, 2020, World Health Organization (WHO), 2020) 
	for the recommendation of cloth face mask use. 
	Based on the very low-level evidence from laboratory studies and the precautionary principle, 
	we recommend 
	cloth face mask use in community settings only if medical face masks are unavailable. 
	Additionally, high compliance and adherence to the recommendations by the general population 
	are necessary for the maximal effectiveness of interventions to prevent transmission of respiratory infections in community settings.


Also this from science direct(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042720300117?via%3Dihub)

	In summary, the benefit to routine face mask use by the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic
	remains uncertain, but our initial mathematical modeling work suggests a possible strong potential benefit to near universal adoption of even weakly effective homemade masks that may synergize with, not replace, other control and mitigation measures.

There is similar stuff from the royal society, but as in the case above, they stress the uncertainty and you might notice that there is no hard data. It is all "modelling" and they have generated sample data with parameters to fit their viewpoint. The code for models 1 and 2 is available at https://github.com/camepidem/COVID-19_PRSA.

The misuse of the precautionary principle caught my eye and after a bit of further digging i found this gem from  Trisha Greenhalgh and her colleagues at the [British Medical Journal](https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/369/bmj.m1435.full.pdf). 

where after a rapid search they found the following studies. 

- A 2011 Cochrane review covering physical interventions and including 67 studies (many of poor quality), in which the main relevant study was a 2009 trial that showed a benefit of masks over no masks, but no benefit of respirator masks over standard ones, and also showed that masks were worn less than 50% of the time 

- A 2010 systematic review of face masks in influenza epidemics, which included standard surgical masks and respirator masks and found some efficacy of masks if worn by those with respiratory symptoms but not if worn by asymptomatic individuals.

- A 2007 systematic review and expert panel deliberation,which acknowledged the difficulties in interpreting evidence and stated: “With the exception of some evidence from SARS, we did not find any published data that directly support the use of masks ... by the public.

- Xiao and colleagues identified 10 randomised controlled trials published between 1946 and 2018 that tested the efficacy of face masks (including standard surgical masks and commercially produced paper face masks designed for the public) for preventing laboratory confirmed influenza.  None showed a significant reduction in laboratory confirmed influenza in the face mask arm. The authors concluded: “randomized controlled trials of[face masks] did not support a substantial effect on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza.

- A preprint of a systematic review published on 6 April 2020 examined whether wearing a face mask or other barrier (goggles,shield, veil) prevents transmission of respiratory illness such as coronavirus, rhinovirus, tuberculosis, or influenza. It identified 31 eligible studies, including 12 randomised controlled trials.The authors found that overall, mask wearing both in general and by infected members within households seemed to produce small but statistically non-significant reductions in infection rates. The authors concluded that “The evidence is not sufficiently strong to support the widespread use of face masks as a protective measure against covid-19” and recommended further high quality randomised controlled trials.

They conclude by stating that None of the studies mentioned above tested the makeshift cloth masks that CDC has recommended. To our knowledge, there are no trials of cloth masks in the general public. 

I don't know why they could nt find the [vietnamese study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4420971/)
which found that 

    	The rates of all infection outcomes were highest in the cloth mask arm.
    	Cloth masks also had significantly higher rates of flu-like symptoms compared with the control arm.



### Arguments against masks

 1. there is limited evidence that they are effective.
		The first argument can be challenged on the grounds that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence

 2. trials have shown that people are unlikely to wear them properly or consistently,

 3. the trials cited above have also shown that wearing a mask might make people feel safe and hence disregard other important public health advice such as hand washing and social distancing.
 4. public should not wear them since health careworkers need them more, and public buying could lead to major supply chain problems

 In conclusion, in the face of a pandemic the search for perfect
 evidence may be the enemy of good policy. As with parachutes for jumping out of aeroplanes,38 it is time to act without waiting for randomised controlled trial evidence.3
