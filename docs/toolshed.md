### Passwords

Passwords are hard. We are trying to find a better way, but for the time being I strongly suggest you use a password manager. 

[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) is highly recommended

also [keepass](https://keepass.info/)

I expect the number of service providers to keep rising. Long passwords, random as you can, special characters and all.

### git vs github vs gitlab vs not git

All of these decisions are up to you. There are some links below. bear in mind that all software is really easy to copy and share.
You can find a chatbot app in one repository and recreate it in another. I like being able to work offline and then just push changes and additions as required, but I have a local copy of this repo on my own pc, and I get everything working here first.
