First they closed the events, cultural gatherings, and festivals. 
And I said nothing, because I can do without them for a while. 
(That the event industry is slowly dying is irrelevant.)  
Then they closed the offices. 
And I said nothing, because working from home is anyhow what I do. 
(It is irrelevant that companies will have to dispose of empty buildings at some point, so that working from home will only become the future more and more.)  
Then I was only allowed to visit my brother, with Down syndrome, outside and/or separated from the rest of the group. 
But I said nothing, because at least I could still see my brother. 
(That my brother, for whom routine is very important, is taken out of his familiar situation/rhythm is irrelevant.)  
Then they closed the catering industry, bars, and restaurants. 
And I said nothing, because I have a big house anyway and I did not go out so much anyhow. 
(That entrepreneurs in this industry miss out on huge incomes, see their life's work go to shit, are close to despair, and even become depressed is irrelevant.)  
Then they closed the non-essential stores. 
And I said nothing, because I can also buy my stuff online. 
(The fact that entrepreneurs also miss out on huge incomes in this industry, see their life's work go to shit, are close to despair and even become depressed is also irrelevant.)  
Then they closed the universities, the high schools, secondary educational centers, and the polytechnics. 
And I said nothing, because my son and daughter are doing fine. 
(The fact that there are students who now increasingly crawl into their shells, become depressed by loneliness, and attempt suicide is not relevant for the moment.)  
Then they closed all the primary schools. 
And I didn't say anything because I don't have kids going there anymore. 
(That parents who work from home now have a dual function, causing them to be overworked and overwrought, is not relevant.)  
Then they closed the borders for fun traffic. 
And I said nothing. I sometimes don't see my family abroad for quite some time, so I can do without it for a while. 
(The fact that there are people who have not been on holiday for years and therefore cannot enjoy a well-deserved and perhaps much-needed holiday, is not relevant now.)  
Then they closed the regular hospital care and prioritized corona. 
And I said nothing, because I'm fine. 
(The fact that there are patients with life-threatening illnesses whose care is being delayed that may shorten their lives is irrelevant right now.)  
Then they closed the so called "contact professions". 
And I said nothing, because I can do without a hairdresser or pedicure for a while. 
(The fact that there are people who desperately need a pedicure treatment or blind guide dogs who are now not allowed to go to a groomer, so that they can no longer properly guide their owners outside, does not matter now.)  
Then many companies around us went bankrupt. 
And I said nothing, because I am sure of my job and income. 
(It is irrelevant that other people go into depression due to debt and develop heart failure and / or attempt suicide.)  
Then they locked me up in my house in the evenings at predetermined times because of a curfew. 
And I said nothing, because I can handle that for a while and I am not a night person anyway.  Plus, I own two dogs. 
(That there are people who languish in loneliness even more does not matter now.)  
And then……….  it kept going one step further 
And I….… I remind myself again that we do this for the other, that we do this for our health. 
And above all we all keep repeating ..... 
We do it for the elderly 
We do it for the faint of heart 
We do it for healthcare 
We do it for your Grandpa and / or Grandma 
We do it for your Father and / or Mother 
We do it for your own health 
We do it for your own safety 
Because of these affirmations we automatically start believing in it !!  
It's only for a moment 
It will only take two weeks 
It will only take two months 
It only takes half a year 
IT ALREADY LASTS A YEAR !! 
And it will take much longer.  
The longer it takes, the less chance we have to get our old-fashioned normal FREEDOM back.  
It will not stop, not by itself!!  
When is it enough for you?   
When do you get up?

 What the public said:

    I think this event is completely irresponsible and inconsiderate of others. 
    I really don't want to be involved in spreading covid or encouraging others to do so. 
    A woman my age who I did editing for, as well as another friend's brother (54) 
    and an acquaintance’s mother recently died from covid.
    It's not a joke, and it's not "woke" to refuse to socially distance
    Forfeiting a swim at  popular beaches is really not much of a sacrifice 
    in the face of people dying
